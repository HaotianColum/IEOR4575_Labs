Then, complete problems 1 and 2 found in lab1_problem1.ipynb and lab1_problem2.ipynb, respectively.

## Visualization
You can see your performance curves in wandb window within the Jupyter notebook (see bottom of the notebook) or find them at ```wandb.ai/ieor-4575/lab1?workspace=default```

## Leaderboard
Move your best results and see others' best results to leaderboard at ```wandb.ai/ieor-4575/leaderboard1?workspace=default```

## Submission
We will check your performance relative to others on the leaderboard for grading. However, a final submissions of your code must be made on courseworks before the deadline.

## Caution
Do not attempt to change any code in the jupyter notebook that is marked "DO NOT CHANGE"! We choose to make grading as transparent as possible. However, we will have an exact copy of your submitted code along with your performance curves on wandb.
